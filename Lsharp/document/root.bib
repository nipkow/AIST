This does not mean that it reports the results of any experimentation on actual physical models, but rather it is concerned with what kinds of conclusions about the internal conditions of a finite machine it is possible to draw from external experiments. To emphasize the conceptual nature of these experiments, the word "gedanken-experiments" has been borrowed from the physicists for the title.The sequential machines considered have a finite number of states, a finite number of possible input symbols, and a finite number of possible output symbols.},

	abstract = {A Teacher knows a regular language L(G), in the form of a finite state acceptor. A method is described for selecting a set of examples, strings X, each in L(G) as inputs to the Pupil. The Set X is mapped into a lattice W (in Pupil) of finite state machines. A mapping is defined from pairs of machines in the lattice W into strings y, each of which serves as a ”crucial experiment”. The Teacher is asked to decide if the string y belongs to L(G). The process then repeats or terminates. This procedure is shown to converge (if Teacher answers truthfully) to a finite state acceptor accepting only strings of L(G)(which obviously may be brought into canonical, minimal state form). However, this process does not depend on state minimization as an inference method. The only necessary condition for the inference process is that every move (edge) of that finite state acceptor U(X) chosen to correspond to L(G) must be applied at least once in generating some string x in X. A proof is given that if the Teacher answers correctly, the Pupil will infer a machine behaviorally equivalent to the original acceptor U. Elements of the lattice W are constructed by successive refinement of the partitions of the state set of the initial finite state machine U(X). Pairs are chosen in an ordered process and converted to deterministic and completely specified machines, if necessary. The two machines are tested for behavioral equivalence. If they are equivalent, one is eliminated. If not, a testing string y belonging to one machine, but not the other, is constructed and output to the teacher. If y belongs to L(G), one machine is eliminated. If not, y is tested by the Pupil against a sequence of machines generated internally. If only one machine is left, the process terminates, otherwise two new candidate machines are chosen. The algorithm described is relatively simple and easy to understand, but does not necessarily produce a minimal time solution.}}

	abstract="Two main approaches are used for increasing the quality of systems: in model checking, one checks properties of a known design of a system; in testing, one usually checks whether a given implementation, whose internal structure is often unknown, conforms with an abstract design. We are interested in the combination of these techniques. Namely, we would like to be able to test whether an implementation with unknown structure satisfies some given properties. We propose and formalize this problem of black box checking and suggest several algorithms. Since the input to black box checking is not given initially, as is the case in the classical model of computation, but is learned through experiments, we propose a computational model based on games with incomplete information. We use this model to analyze the complexity of the problem. We also address the more practical question of finding an approach that can detect errors in the implementation before completing an exhaustive search.",

	abstract="In this paper we present TTT, a novel active automata learning algorithm formulated in the Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) framework. The distinguishing characteristic of TTT is its redundancy-free organization of observations, which can be exploited to achieve optimal (linear) space complexity. This is thanks to a thorough analysis of counterexamples, extracting and storing only the essential refining information. TTT is therefore particularly well-suited for application in a runtime verification context, where counterexamples (obtained, e.g., via monitoring) may be excessively long: as the execution time of a test sequence typically grows with its length, this would otherwise cause severe performance degradation. We illustrate the impact of TTT's consequent redundancy-free approach along a number of examples.",

We improve the lower bound of cite{BalcazarDG97} on the combined number of output and equivalence queries required by any learning algorithm, and give a simpler proof. We prove that in the worst case $L^{#}$ needs $n-1$ equivalence queries to learn an FSM with $n$ states, and establish lower bounds on the number of output queries needed by $L^{#}$ in the worst case. In practical applications, the maximum length of the shortest separating sequence for all pairs of inequivalent states (MS3) is often just $1$ or $2$. We present $L^{#}_h$, a version of $L^{#}$ with bounded lookahead $h$, which learns FSMs with an MS3 of at most $h$ without requiring any equivalence queries, and give lower and upper bounds on its complexity.}

	abstract = {We present new algorithms for inferring an unknown finite-state automaton from its input/output behavior, even in the absence of a means of resetting the machine to a start state. A key technique used is inference of a homing sequence for the unknown automaton. Our inference procedures experiment with the unknown machine, and from time to time require a teacher to supply counterexamples to incorrect conjectures about the structure of the unknown automaton. In this setting, we describe a learning algorithm that, with probability 1 − δ, outputs a correct description of the unknown machine in time polynomial in the automaton′s size, the length of the longest counterexample, and log(1/δ). We present an analogous algorithm that makes use of a diversity-based representation of the finite-state system. Our algorithms are the first which are provably effective for these problems, in the absence of a "reset." We also present probabilistic algorithms for permutation automata which do not require a teacher to supply counterexamples. For inferring a permutation automaton of diversity D, we improve the best previous time bound by roughly a factor of D3/log D.}

As systems become ever more complex and development becomes more distributed, inferred models of system behavior become an increasingly valuable asset for understanding and analyzing a system's behavior. Five years ago (in 2011) we have surveyed the then current state of active automata learning research and applications of active automata learning in practice. We predicted four major topics to be addressed in the then near future: efficiency, expressivity of models, bridging the semantic gap between formal languages and analyzed components, and solutions to the inherent problem of incompleteness of active learning in black-box scenarios. In this paper we review the progress that has been made over the past five years, assess the status of active automata learning techniques with respect to applications in the field of software engineering, and present an updated agenda for future research.",
