\title{Parikh's theorem}
\author{Fabian Lehr}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This library introduces Parikh images of formal languages and
  proves Parikh's theorem. The proof closely follows Pilling's proof \cite{Pilling}:
  It describes a context free grammar as a system of equations and
  shows that there exists a minimal solution to this system which is
  regular. Thus, this regular solution and the context free language
  accepted by the grammar have the same Parikh image.
