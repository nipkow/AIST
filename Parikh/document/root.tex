\title{Parikh's theorem}
\author{Fabian Lehr}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This library introduces Parikh images of formal languages and
  proves Parikh's theorem. The proof closely follows Pilling's proof
  \cite{Pilling}:
  It describes a context free language as a minimal solution to a
  system of equations induced by a context free grammar for this
  language. Then it is shown that there exists a minimal solution
  to this system which is regular, such that the regular solution and the
  context free language have the same Parikh image.
