text \<open>This file contains all the constructions needed for the chomsky-schuetzenberger theorem.
We follow closely Automata and Computability @1997 pp 198â€“200 by Dexter C. Kozen for the proof.

This theorem roughly states, that each type 2 language \<open>L\<close> can be written as 
\<open>h(R \<inter> dyck_lang(\<Gamma>))\<close> for suitable alphabet Gamma, a regular language R, and a monoid-homomorphism h.


The dyck language over some set \<open>\<Gamma>\<close> (also called bracket language) is defined as follows:  
The symbols of Gamma are thought of as opening brackets. 
For each symbol a closing bracket is added.
The dyck language over Gamma then is the language of correctly bracketed terms.

We implement this cloning of Gamma, by pairing each element \<open>g \<in> \<Gamma>\<close> either with an Element from
\<open>datatype bracket = Op | Cl\<close>, as in \<open>Cl, g\<close>.


A (very) rough proof overview of chomsky-schuetzenberger is as follows:
Take some type 2 Grammar for \<open>L\<close> with Productions \<open>P\<close>, assume it in Chomsky normal form.
From the old Productions \<open>P\<close> define new Productions \<open>P'\<close> using \<open>transform_production\<close>: 
if \<open>\<pi> = A \<rightarrow> BC\<close>  let \<open>\<pi>' = A \<rightarrow> [\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>1  B  ]\<^sub>p\<^sup>1  [\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>2  C  ]\<^sub>p\<^sup>2\<close>
elif \<open>\<pi> = A \<rightarrow> a\<close> let \<open>\<pi>' = A \<rightarrow> [\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>1     ]\<^sub>p\<^sup>1  [\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>2     ]\<^sub>p\<^sup>2\<close>
\<open>B\<close> and \<open>C\<close> on the right side, are again viewed as Nonterminals,
the brackets \<open>[\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>1\<close> are terminals. This means, we need a second copy of each production, 
and then pair these with brackets for the non-terminal type - 
\<open>bracket \<times> (old prod. type \<times> (type of ){1,2})\<close>

This bracketing encodes the parse tree of any old expression in the word-output, and it turns out one can recover the old word by the homomorphism \<open>h\<close>, which sends \<open>[\<^sub>\<pi>\<^sup>1\<close> to \<open>a\<close> if \<open>\<pi> = A \<rightarrow> a\<close>, and sends every other bracket to \<open>\<epsilon>\<close>.

Thus \<open>h(L') = L\<close> (*), so all we need to show is, that L' is of the form \<open>R \<inter> dyck_language \<Gamma>\<close>.

\<open>R\<^sub>A\<close> is defined via an intersection of 5 regular languages. Each of these is defined via a property of words (actually the fith one has an additional parameter, a variable of the old kind) which is chosen to be the start symbol, so \<open>R := R\<^sub>S\<close> (**).

We take the easiest \<open>\<Gamma>\<close> one can imagine with the right type: \<open>\<Gamma> = P \<times> {1,2}\<close>.

One then shows \<open>A \<rightarrow>\<^sub>G\<^sub>'\<^sup>* x \<longleftrightarrow> x \<in> R\<^sub>A \<inter> dyck_language \<Gamma>\<close>. (***) This is where the main work of the proof goes into.
Using this then for the old start symbol S gives the desired equation \<open>L' = R \<inter> dyck_language \<Gamma>\<close>
\<close>



text\<open>What is done and what is missing:

The equation in (*) should be an easy induction on the derivation - it's missing. If one looks closer we need an extended version of \<open>h\<close> that can also be applied on variables - we defined this as \<open>h_ext\<close>. We showed that this does basically the same as \<open>h\<close> on the terminals (modulo the Tm operators ...) in \<open>h_ext (map Tm x) = map Tm (h x)\<close>. Presumably one can do the induction with \<open>h_ext\<close> and then reduce this to a result for \<open>h\<close>.

The definition of what it means to be a regular language is a placeholder - it's a straight up copy of the type 2 definition. One needs to show that the intersection of regulars is regular and that the \<open>R\<^sub>A\<close> are regular. This is missing. The textbook says that regular expressions might be a good entry point for this - these are also already formalized in the AFP. Also one should check the formalization of the 5 properties again - these might be right, but i didn't spend any time on them, as they are not really used yet, they are needed for the lemma in the next paragraph. Maybe they also can be formulated with less index-bound checking.

The Lemma (***) is missing. This is the main mathematics of the proof, it involes one easy direction and one hard. This is the only part where one needs the definitions of the regular languages. In the textbook this is a (local) lemma.\<close>
